This is a very simple counter browser extension i made for opening a manga chapter with ease without having to remember which chapter u last read
It automatically updates without u even having to press the + and - buttons, they are there for the just incase the count messes up or something idk.

To use yourself:

    Go to: -://extensions
    Make sure dev mode is on
    Load unpacked and then select the folder
