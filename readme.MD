This is a very simple counter browser extension i made for opening a manga chapter with ease without having to remember which chapter u last read.

It automatically updates without u even having to press the + and - buttons, they are there for the just incase the count messes up or something idk.

If you want to add your own manga url (not CSM), then you will have to change the link in the js and probably also the regex and maybe the logic. (might add link adding in the future)

To use yourself:

    Go to: -://extensions
    Make sure dev mode is on
    Load unpacked and then select the folder
